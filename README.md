# piscine-scrapper

This project automatically tracks the real-time attendance of the "Judaïque - Jean Boiteux" swimming pool in Bordeaux using the city's Open Data API. A GitHub Action runs a Python script every 5 minutes to fetch the current number of swimmers and append the data to a CSV file. The goal is to build a historical dataset to analyze attendance patterns and eventually predict future peak hours using machine learning.
